# OddEvenGame
This is a game based on the Odd-Eve hand game except the opponent is a computer.
How to play OddEven?
First of all, like cricket the game starts off with a toss!
The computer chooses a number 1-10 along with odd or eve, so does the player.
If the sum of numbers of computer and player is odd, then the one who choses odd would win and same for even.
After the toss they have to choses whether to bat or bowl.
An innings will go until both the players choose the same number. 
If this happens, the batsman will be out.
